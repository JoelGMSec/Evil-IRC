# Evil-IRC
**Evil-IRC** is an Old School IRC Backdoor writed in Perl.

This script allows you to execute code on an infected victim. You can do all sorts of things like make it write to other channels, send private messages to other users or execute commands on the operating system. All this without the victim knowing, as the tool hooks the messages so that they are not displayed in the IRC client.


# Requirements (on victim side)
- X-Chat or compatible (like HexChat)
- Install Perl Module on IRC client
- Load Evil-IRC.pl script
